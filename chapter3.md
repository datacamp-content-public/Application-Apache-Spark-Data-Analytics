## (Capstone) Practicing caching

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 6b93918e78
xp: 100
```

This exercise practices caching two dataframes, one of which depends on the other. A dataframe `df1` is loaded from a csv file. Several processing steps are performed on this dataframe. `df1` has 606,568 rows. As `df1` is to be used more than once it is a candidate for caching.

A second dataframe `df2` is created by copying `df1`, then performing additional compute-intensive steps. It has 499,691 rows.  It is also a candidate for caching.  However, because `df2` depends on `df1` the question arises: should we cache `df1`, or cache `df2`, or cache both?  Note that caching incurs a cost. Caching costs run time as well as memory.

The two dataframes are created, Then, four operations are performed on the two dataframes, two on `df1` and two on `df2`.  Each operation is timed.

`@instructions`
* There are two cache statements called "Caching df1" and "Caching df2".  Initially the second one is commented out. 
* There are four timed operations captioned `df1_1st`, `df1_2nd`, `df2_1st`, and `df2_2nd`.
* Below the four timed operations are True or False questions.  
* Set the corresponding variable below the question to True if you believe the answer is True.  Otherwise set it to False.

`@hint`
Try enabling or disabling the commented out caching statements and running (without submitting). Try all four combinations.

## Splitting the train data

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
key: 2f5ebc22a7
xp: 100
```

Split the training data into two subsets, one for training, and one held out for evaluating the trained model. We'll use a seed of 42 so that the result is the same each time.
